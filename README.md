scDecipher is a toolkit to decipher the dominant cell communication assembly with specific functional influence by utilizing multi-view graph attention network. (i) scDecipher takes advantage of four state-of-the-art cell–cell communication analysis tools to systematically and reliably infer ligand–receptor (L-R) pairs from single-cell RNA sequencing data. (ii) Based on prior knowledge of L-R pairs and gene expression profile, scDecipher constructs a multi-view cell-cell communication network between different cell types at single-cell resolution by using an edge weighting strategy and filtering out edges with low specificity. (iii) scDecipher develops a multi-view graph attention network to predict the expression pattern of target genes or the functional status of receiver cells, and then deciphers the dominant cell communication assembly by interpreting the trained model. The overview figure of scDecipher is shown as follows.

The overview of scDecipher. **(a)** The schematic diagram of a full picture of cell-cell communication (CCC). LR: Ligand-Receptor; $E$: gene expression profile; $E_{0}$: baseline expression determined by cell type; $\Delta E$: expression change caused by CCC. $F$: functional states of malignant cells; $F_{0}$: baseline state determined by the cell itself; $\Delta F$: state change caused by CCC. **(b)** The construction of multi-view CCC network at single-cell resolution. First, four excellent CCC tools were applied to infer ligand-receptor pairs from single cell expression profiles. Second, an edge weighting strategy was applied to calculate the CCC strength at single-cell resolution based on the inferred LR pairs. Third, low specificity CCCs caused by widely expressed ligands (or receptors) or sequencing technology errors were filtered out. Fourth, the CCC graphs between each pair of different cell types were constructed, where the nodes in the graph represent single cells and the edges represent the communication strength between single cells calculated in the previous step. **(c)** The multi-view graph attention learning for predicting target gene expression or functional states of malignant cells. First, each CCC graph obtained from step b was trained by a graph convolutional network (GCN) and subjected to a nonlinear transformation by ReLU function, where the input contained the CCC strength matrix as the adjacency matrix and the one-hot encoding matrix obtained according to cell types as the initial feature matrix of the nodes. Second, the gene expressions or functional states obtained under different views were fused by an attention mechanism and then retrained using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to estimate $\Delta E/\Delta F$. Third, another MLP was applied to estimate  $E_{0}/F_{0}$ based on the cell-type matrix. Fourth, two estimations were summed as the final prediction results and trained iteratively to minimise the mean square error (MSE) with the true gene expression profiles or functional states. **(d)** The main function of scDecipher.
